# Projet Système 1ère année

This project was made during my first year at ENSTA Bretagne, the objectives were to understand GNSS and especially GPS positionning, to build a Python program able to acquire NMEA data from a GPS reciever and to display it on a map. The report is available in the repository (in French).


The GPS reciever we used was a GSTAR IV by GlobalSat plugged via USB to a laptop.
The display is made using a map of our school containing positionning data, it will not work outside of the school.

To use the program, run python-files/GNSS_nmea.py.
